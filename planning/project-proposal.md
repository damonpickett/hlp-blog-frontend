# High Level Programming Blog

This will be a blog for articulating programming concepts at a high level. I will be creating the back-end with Python/Django and the front-end with React.js. It will be dead simple. A list of all blog entries will be listed on the homepage. Those list items will link to a route which replaces the list with the content of whichever entry was selected.

## Potential Hurdles

Connecting the front-end to the back-end is still a murky concept for me, and we did not go over using Django with React (not sure how much difference it makes though) but this may require extra study/debugging.

I've never used Summernote before so it's implementation may also give me some trouble.

Deploying the backend is also something that my project 3 team and I struggled with, doing it on my own may be challenging.
